# PRODIGY_CS_01 – Caesar Cipher (Python)

🔐 **Task 01 – Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship**

This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a classic substitution cipher that shifts letters in the alphabet based on a given key.

---

## 📌 Features
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar Cipher logic
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters like punctuation and spaces
- Accepts user input for both message and shift value

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Basics of classical encryption techniques
- Modular arithmetic and character manipulation in Python
- Writing clean, readable, and interactive scripts
- Secure coding practices like input validation
